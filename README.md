# DepthMap-with-Google-AI

I use an image to create its DepthMap on StereoPhoto Maker. 

StereoPhoto Maker has the function to create a Depth-Map by using the Google AI. But you have to implement the file http://stereo.jpn.org/jpn/stphmkr/google/indexe.html at the local disk. 

I also use the code from Red Stapler to create the 3D Effect Image on the web browser.

# Tips
Add the extension Go Live at Visual Studio, it's easier to see the changes on the code 

If you have problems to use pythord on pip command, 
download anaconda and do all the possible steps at the anaconda prompt 

If you have dificulties to open c:\2dtodepth\prog\2dtodepth.bat, you can always change the anaconda prompt

To change the anaconda prompt:
1- Go to Anaconda Prompt 
2- Right-click -Open file location
3- Righ-click-Properties
4- And in Start in:, change to C:\2dtodepth
